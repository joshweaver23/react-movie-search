In the language/framework of your choice, create a dynamic view that contains the following items:
    - Text Field (should contain search text)
    - Button (should launch search)
    - Table View (should display search results)

When the search button is pressed, please use the following API call to query and fetch results:

GET https://www.omdbapi.com/?s=<url_encoded_movie_title>&r=json

We have stubbed out a basic Bootstrap template (view/index.html) for you to use if you wish.
